    "\n",
    "This study introduces PHARMACOM-EPI, a novel framework that uses medication plasma concentrations and administrative/healthcare databases to substantiate safety signals. It investigates the FDA's warning on lamotrigine (an anti-seizure drug) and its potential to increase the risk of arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death due to its sodium channel-blocking effect. The study hypothesizes that the risk is due to toxicity. Using Danish registry data of older patients (65+), the framework predicts lamotrigine plasma concentrations at the time of death. Patients are categorized into toxic and non-toxic groups based on the therapeutic range of lamotrigine (3-15 mg/L). The results showed that cardiovascular-related deaths were mostly in individuals with toxic plasma concentrations. The increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular death was associated with toxic plasma concentration levels of lamotrigine in older users.\n",

    "##### **Objective**\n",
    "To investigate the association between lamotrigine's plasma concentrations and the risk of death in older patients, following an FDA warning about the drug's potential to increase the risk of arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Methods**\n",
    "- The PHARMACOM-EPI framework was applied using Danish nationwide administrative and healthcare registers.\n",
    "- The study population included individuals aged 65 years or older diagnosed with epilepsy and exposed to lamotrigine between 1996 and 2018.\n",
    "- Lamotrigine plasma concentrations were predicted at the time of death, and patients were categorized into non-toxic and toxic groups based on the therapeutic range of lamotrigine (3–15 mg/L).\n",
    "- The incidence rate ratio (IRR) of all-cause mortality was calculated between propensity score-matched toxic and non-toxic groups over one year of treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Results**\n",
    "- The majority of lamotrigine-associated deaths were cardiovascular-related and occurred in individuals with toxic plasma concentrations.\n",
    "- The IRR of mortality between the toxic and non-toxic groups was 3.37, and the cumulative incidence of all-cause mortality increased exponentially in the toxic range.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Conclusion**\n",
    "The study provides strong evidence that an increased risk of all-cause and cardiovascular death is associated with toxic plasma concentrations of lamotrigine among older users. The PHARMACOM-EPI framework is presented as a valuable tool for pharmacological substantiation of safety signals.\n",

    "- This paper presents a data driven method for estimating the duration of pharmacological prescriptions using secondary data sources when direct information on prescription length is missing.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- Introduces Sessa Empirical Estimator (SEE), which applies a k-means clustering algorithm to determine prescription duration based on real-world and simulated data.\n",

    "### **How does Sessa Emperical Estimator (SEE) work?**\n",
    "- Uses k-means clustering to group patiens based on how often they refill prescriptions\n",
    "- Estimates length of each prescription using patters found in available prescription records\n",
    "- Reduces the need for assumptions ex. assuming all patients only take 1 pill a day\n",

    "### **Generalized Step-by-Step process for using SEE**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Collect Event Data**\n",
    "   - Gather timestamped records of the recurring event\n",
    "   - Ex. Purchase history\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Filter and Preprocess Data**\n",
    "   - Remove outliers and inconsistent\n",
    "   - Standardize data formats\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Extract Event Intervals**\n",
    "   - Compute the time difference between consecutive events for each entity (ex. prescription refills, purchases, hospital visits)\n",
    "   - If data is sparse, exclude long gaps due to external factors\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Randomly Select One Interval per Entity**\n",
    "   - This prevents over-representing entities that have frequent occurrences.\n",
    "   - Example: If analyzing subscription renewals, use one renewal period per customer instead of all.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Standardize Time Intervals**\n",
    "   - Normalize time intervals by scaling (subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation).\n",
    "   - This ensures that the clustering algorithm treats all data points equally.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Apply K-Means Clustering**\n",
    "   - Group entities based on similar interval patterns.\n",
    "   - Use Silhouette Analysis to determine the optimal number of clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Assign a Duration for Each Cluster**\n",
    "   - Calculate the median event interval for each cluster.\n",
    "   - Assign this median value as the estimated duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Compute Event End Times**\n",
    "   - For each entity, estimate the end time of the event based on the assigned duration.\n"
