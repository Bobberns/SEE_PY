    "**Objective**: To develop and apply a novel method for assessing co-exposure to free-dose combination therapy using secondary data. The study aims to describe co-exposure to selected antihypertensive medications among older individuals in Denmark.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methodology**: A register-based cohort study was conducted on individuals aged 65 years or older in Denmark who initiated antihypertensive therapy between 1996 and 2016 and were followed for 730 days. The new method involves assessing medication events, co-exposure, and creating treatment episodes. The accuracy of the method was evaluated using a random sample of 400 individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Sources**: Data was collected from Danish registries, including the Civil Registration System, Register of Causes of Death, Register of Medicinal Product Statistics, Income Statistics Register, Population Education Register, and the National Patient Register.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Study Population**: The study included 1,021,819 individuals aged 65 or above who redeemed an antihypertensive medication between 1996 and 2016.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Findings**: \n",
    "- The newly developed method achieved 100% accuracy in identifying co-exposure periods.\n",
    "- During the early stage of follow-up (0–180 days), 54.1% of individuals were co-exposed to at least two antihypertensive medications, while 37.5% were co-exposed during the late stage of the follow-up period (181–730 days).\n",
    "- The most frequent antihypertensive combinations included bendroflumethiazide and potassium with either amlodipine or enalapril in the early (13.2% and 12.5% of patients, respectively) and late stages (16.9% and 15.0% of patients, respectively).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Significance**: The study's findings reveal common co-exposure combinations and evolving trends in antihypertensive medication use among older individuals, reflecting changes in clinical practice and guidelines over two decades. The method helps overcome limitations in accurately assessing co-exposure to multiple antihypertensive medications. The emerging shift from free-dose combinations to fixed-dose combinations is highlighted, with fixed-dose combinations improving adherence\n",

    "Simply put, this study creates a new tool **to track how older adults take multiple blood pressure pills at the same time**. Researchers used this tool with Danish health data and found that about half of older adults starting blood pressure treatment were taking multiple medications together. The study also showed **which combinations of pills were most commonly used and how those patterns changed over time**. This information can help doctors better understand and manage blood pressure medication use in older adults.\n",

    "This PDF is a research article describing a new method called the **\"Sessa Empirical Estimator\" (SEE)**, a new data-driven method for computing the duration of pharmacological prescriptions using secondary data sources when information is missing or incomplete. The SEE is **designed to estimate how long a prescription lasts (the duration) when that information is missing or incomplete in healthcare databases**. This is important for research that studies how people use medications over time (pharmacoepidemiology), as it *helps determine exposure to a drug*. The SEE **uses a data-driven approach based on the k-means algorithm to group prescription patterns and estimate durations**. The paper evaluates the SEE's accuracy using both simulated and real-world data, comparing its performance to a simpler method.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Overview Summary:*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Addressed**: Assessing the duration of filled prescriptions is crucial in pharmacoepidemiological studies for investigating treatment persistence, effectiveness, and safety. However, secondary data sources often lack complete information on the prescribed dose and daily consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proposed Solution**: The SEE method uses a k-means algorithm to compute the duration of prescriptions when information is missing. It aims to minimise assumptions typically used in automating the computation of prescription durations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methodology:\n",
    "- The SEE method **relies on individual-level data on the date of filling prescriptions**. It assumes that the duration of a filled prescription is associated with the temporal distance between subsequent prescriptions and that the dispensed amount is consumed between fillings.\n",
    "- The algorithm **clusters temporal distances between filled prescriptions into groups with similar patterns** and assigns durations based on these clusters.\n",
    "- The method involves several steps:\n",
    "  1.  including computing empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDF) of temporal distances,\n",
    "  2.  standardising temporal distances,\n",
    "  3.  using the K-means algorithm for clustering, and\n",
    "  4.  building probability density functions (PDF) to determine median temporal distances for each cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation**: The SEE method was evaluated **using simulated and real-world data** to assess its accuracy in determining exposure status and prescription duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simulated Data**: Simulated data mimicked real-world prescription patterns with varying refill intensities. The \"true\" exposure duration was compared to the SEE-assessed duration.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Real-World Data**: Real-world data from Danish administrative registers were used, focusing on drugs with therapeutic drug monitoring. Detectable plasma concentrations were used as a proxy for \"true\" exposure status.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Comparison**: The SEE method was compared to a Researcher-Defined Duration (RDD) method that assumes a fixed daily dose of one unit per day.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results**:\n",
    "- In simulated data, the SEE achieved high accuracy (96%) and sensitivity (96%).\n",
    "- In real-world data, the SEE showed sensitivity ranging from 78.0% to 95.1%, depending on the drug.\n",
    "- Compared to the RDD method, the SEE had a lower median sensitivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**: The SEE demonstrates promising properties for assessing exposure status when treatment duration information is unavailable. The data-driven approach can automate the computation of prescription durations while maintaining good properties and can be applied in drug utilisation studies and comparative effectiveness research. Further research is needed to validate the method in different settings.\n",

    "Simply put, this study introduces a new tool, the Sessa Empirical Estimator (SEE), to figure out how long prescriptions last when that information isn't available. It's like a detective for medication use, using patterns in when people refill their prescriptions to guess how long each prescription lasted. The tool was tested and found to be pretty accurate, making it useful for studying how people use medications over time.\n",

    "1. **Collect Event Data**\n",

    "4. **Randomly Select One Interval per Entity**\n",
